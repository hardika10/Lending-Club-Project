It is utmost important to predict credit worthiness of each borrower as precisely as possible.Hence,
our project focuses on modeling three different classification models namely Logistic Regression, 
Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.Our goal is to determine whether a borrower will default or not on the
basis of their profile and loan characteristics. Finally, we will come up with the best fitted model for 
predicting credit worthiness.

Important Note :-
1.It is required to re-run data processing step for test data so that we have same set of binary dummy variables as that of train data set. 
To do data processing for test data set, please un-comment test data code and comment train data code mentioned in red after splitting data.
2.Next, re-run the code above Modeling section.
